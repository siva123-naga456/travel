            Our drivers would pick up from the JKIA airport at 7AM. You would
            board our 4*4 Landcruisers to embark on your journey to Maasai Mara.
            The road journey takes about 5 to 6 hours, but you would be amazed
            by the landscape enroute. You would first see the Nairobi national
            park on your left side. On a lucky day, you would also see a White
            Rhino grazing near the fence. Nairobi city has a national park right
            in its heart!! And it is home for Lions, Leopards, White rhinos,
            gazzelles, Giraffes, crowned cranes, and other mammals and birds.
            This is the only city in the World which boasts a National park
            within the city limits.This afternoon, our experienced Maasai
            guides/drivers would take you around the Talek and Topi plains area.
            There you would find a lot of ungulates, antelopes, zebras and also
            a huge pride of Lions. This pride is called the ‘Topi Pride’. Relax,
            sit back and enjoy God’s creations. You would be so excited to see
            the endless plains of Maasai Mara with its dwellers. Return to your
            camp after 6PM. Refresh yourself and head towards the camp fire.
            Meet up with your group and listen to their first day experience at
            Mara. Share your magical experiences with them. Have dinner and
            retire for the day

            Wake up early. Freshen yourself and head to the restaurant for a hot
            cup of coffee or tea. The mornings are cold at Mara, so do wear your
            fleece jacket for the morning game drive. Breakfast would be packed
            for you. Explore the mornings at Mara. The Sunrise you witness at
            Mara is something which you would never get to witness anywhere in
            the World. Just pray that it does not rain!!Our guides would park
            the vehicle under a tree for you to have a bush breakfast. This is
            an out of the World experience. At a distance you can see the
            animals peacefully grazing while you are enjoying your food. Post
            your breakfast, proceed again on the game drive. Mid mornings while
            the Lions sleep is a good time to look around for the cheetahs.
            November is also the season when the Topis give birth to young ones.
            On a lucky day, you might witness a Topi giving birth to a little
            one. Keep a watch on the hyenas as they would always be around a
            pregnant Topi!Do ask your driver to stop where ever you want to
            click pictures. Return to the camp post sunset and enjoy your
            evening at the camp fire with your group. Have dinner and retire
            early as you have a full day game drive tomorrow.

            Today is a very busy day for you at Mara. Wake up early, freshen
            yourself, have a hot beverage and jump into your designated
            vehicles. Today you would be going towards the border of Maasai
            Mara. You would be going for a full day game drive with packed
            breakfastand lunch. Sand river is the border for Maasai Mara and
            Tanzania. This has been the entry point of the migratory animals for
            millions of years. You would be amazed to see such a small river
            separates two different countries!! Enjoy every bit your time as
            this is your last day of game drive for this trip. Have lunch and
            take a small nap like our Maasai guides. Then proceed towards your
            camp. On the way back encounter a pride of lion. During your stay at
            Mara, you would have seen the Big 4 our of the Big 5. The Rhino
            being very elusive is going to be a difficult find. But this area is
            know for the Rhinos. If you are lucky you would get to see one.
            Return to the camp with great memories. Spend you evening at the
            camp fire before having dinner. Retire for the day. Sadly the
            holiday has come to an end. But at the end you would release that it
            was the journey which was so beautiful. Have a blissful night.
